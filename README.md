# Gate Founder

This is a simple mod that allows players to build space gates between systems. Building a gate requires founding a 'Space Gate Builder' station and interacting with it to build a gate.

The gate cost scales with the distance of the jump, and in order to maintain some balance gates can only be built targeting systems controlled by the same faction as the gate builder. The gate on the reverse side will be built automatically.
